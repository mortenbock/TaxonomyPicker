# TaxonomyPicker
A datatype for Umbraco for selecting Google Product Taxonomy Categories

## Configuration
By default, the datatype includes the en-US taxonomy file, but you can override this by applying a url to fetch the taxonomy definition from instead.

The url will be requested via Ajax, so it must be browsable by a backend user, and not a file path to the App_Data folder for example.
